# LeetCode Solutions

Welcome to my LeetCode repository!

I am learning Python for my professional development as a Junior Data Analyst and because coding is a fun and
intellectually stimulating challenge for me. This repository contains solutions to various LeetCode problems that I have
solved in Python.

## Goals

- **Improve Problem-Solving Skills**: Continuously enhancing my ability to solve algorithmic challenges in an efficient
  and optimal way.
- **Python Mastery**: Achieving fluency in Python by solving a wide range of problems that test different aspects of the
  language and algorithms.
- **Data Structures & Algorithms**: Deepening my understanding of key data structures (arrays, hash maps, linked lists,
  etc.) and algorithms (greedy, divide and conquer, dynamic programming, etc.).
- **SQL Mastery**: Deepeing my understanging of SQL to better do my job as a Data Analyst
- **Interview Preparation**: Preparing for technical interviews with a focus on LeetCode-style questions that are
  frequently asked in coding interviews.

## Repository Features

- **Automatic Updates**: This repository is updated regularly using LeetSync, ensuring that the latest solutions are
  always available.
- **Comprehensive Solutions**: Solutions to a wide variety of LeetCode problems, each thoroughly explained with comments
  and clear code structure.
- **Problem Categories**:
    - Arrays & Strings
    - Linked Lists
    - Trees & Graphs
    - Hash Maps
    - Dynamic Programming
    - Greedy Algorithms
    - Backtracking
    - SQL

## How to Use This Repository

- Each problem is located in a separate folder named after the problem.
- Inside each folder, you'll find the following:
    - **README.md**: The problem description
    - **Solution file**: Contains the Python solution to the problem.
    - **explanation.md**: A detailed breakdown of the problem-solving approach used, with comments on the code.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Primary programming language used for problem-solving.
- **LeetSync**: Used for automatic updates of the repository.
