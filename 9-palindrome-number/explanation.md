## Palindrome Number

This solution solves the problem of checking whether a given integer is a palindrome using Python’s string manipulation capabilities. Below is a step-by-step explanation of how the code works.

### Code Explanation:

```python
class Solution:
    def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
        return str(x) == str(x)[::-1]
```

### Let’s break it down:

1. **Defining the function:**
   ```python
   def isPalindrome(self, x: int) -> bool:
   ```
    - This method `isPalindrome` takes a single argument, `x`, which is an integer.
    - The method returns a boolean value: `True` if `x` is a palindrome, and `False` otherwise.

2. **Converting the integer to a string:**
   ```python
   str(x)
   ```
    - The integer `x` is converted to its string representation using `str(x)`.
    - This allows us to treat the integer as a sequence of characters, making it easier to manipulate.

3. **Reversing the string:**
   ```python
   str(x)[::-1]
   ```
    - The slicing operation `[::-1]` reverses the string by reading it from the last character to the first.
    - For example, if `x = 123`, `str(x)[::-1]` would return `'321'`.

4. **Checking if the original string is equal to the reversed string:**
   ```python
   str(x) == str(x)[::-1]
   ```
    - This checks whether the string representation of `x` is equal to its reversed version.
    - If they are the same, it means the number reads the same forwards and backwards, making it a palindrome.

5. **Returning the result:**
    - If the original and reversed strings are equal, the method returns `True` (the number is a palindrome).
    - Otherwise, it returns `False` (the number is not a palindrome).

### Example Walkthrough:

Let’s walk through an example using `x = 121`.

#### Step 1:
- Convert `x` to a string: `str(121)` gives `'121'`.

#### Step 2:
- Reverse the string: `'121'[::-1]` gives `'121'`.

#### Step 3:
- Check if the original string is equal to the reversed string: `'121' == '121'` is `True`.

The function returns `True` because `121` is a palindrome.

### Key Python Features Used:

- **String Conversion**: `str(x)` converts an integer to a string.
- **String Slicing**: `[::-1]` reverses the string efficiently.

---

### Time and Space Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**:  
  The time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of digits in the integer `x`. This is because converting the integer to a string and reversing the string both take time proportional to the number of digits.

- **Space Complexity**:  
  The space complexity is **O(n)** as well, since we store the string representation of the number and its reversed version.
