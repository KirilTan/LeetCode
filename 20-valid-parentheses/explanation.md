Here's a step-by-step explanation of the optimized solution to validate if a string of parentheses is balanced.

## Explanation of Solution

### Problem Overview

The goal is to determine if a string containing only the characters `(`, `)`, `{`, `}`, `[`, and `]` has balanced and correctly ordered brackets. A string is considered valid if:
1. Each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.
2. Brackets close in the correct order.

### Code Explanation

Here's the code we're working with:

```python
class Solution:
    @staticmethod
    def isValid(s: str) -> bool:
        # Dictionary to map closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets
        matching_brackets = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}
        stack = []

        for bracket in s:
            # If it's a closing bracket, check for a matching opening bracket at the stack's top
            if bracket in matching_brackets:
                # Pop from stack if it’s not empty; if empty, use a dummy value
                top = stack.pop() if stack else '#'
                if matching_brackets[bracket] != top:
                    return False
            else:
                # If it’s an opening bracket, push onto the stack
                stack.append(bracket)

        # Stack should be empty if all brackets were matched properly
        return not stack
```

### How the Code Works

1. **Dictionary Setup**:
   ```python
   matching_brackets = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}
   ```
    - This dictionary maps each closing bracket to its matching opening bracket.
    - Using a dictionary allows us to quickly look up the expected opening bracket for each closing bracket.

2. **Stack Initialization**:
   ```python
   stack = []
   ```
    - We use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets in the string.
    - When we encounter an opening bracket (`(`, `[`, `{`), we push it onto the stack.
    - When we encounter a closing bracket (`)`, `]`, `}`), we pop from the stack to check if it matches the expected opening bracket.

3. **Processing Each Bracket**:
   ```python
   for bracket in s:
       if bracket in matching_brackets:
           # Pop the top element if stack isn't empty; use '#' if it's empty
           top = stack.pop() if stack else '#'
           if matching_brackets[bracket] != top:
               return False
       else:
           # Push opening bracket onto the stack
           stack.append(bracket)
   ```
    - For each character in the input string `s`:
        - If it’s a **closing bracket**:
            - We check if there’s a corresponding opening bracket at the top of the stack by popping the stack’s top element.
            - If the stack is empty (no corresponding opening bracket), we use `#` as a placeholder.
            - If the popped bracket doesn’t match the expected opening bracket, we return `False` because the brackets are not balanced.
        - If it’s an **opening bracket**:
            - We push it onto the stack.

4. **Final Check for Balance**:
   ```python
   return not stack
   ```
    - At the end of the loop, if the stack is empty, all opening brackets had matching closing brackets, so we return `True`.
    - If the stack isn’t empty, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, so we return `False`.

### Example Walkthrough

#### Input: `{[()]}`
- Stack state:
    - `{` pushed to stack
    - `[` pushed to stack
    - `(` pushed to stack
    - `)` matches `(` at stack’s top (pop `(`)
    - `]` matches `[` at stack’s top (pop `[`)
    - `}` matches `{` at stack’s top (pop `{`)
- Stack is empty, so the output is `True`.

#### Input: `([)]`
- Stack state:
    - `(` pushed to stack
    - `[` pushed to stack
    - `)` does not match `[` at stack’s top; return `False`.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string `s`, because we iterate through the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: **O(n)**, for the stack, in the worst case (e.g., a string of all opening brackets).
